# Machine Learning
Here are a collection of Python Jupyter notebooks for the exercises of Andrew Ng's excellent [machine learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This course is a great way to get started with machine learning, covering the basic concepts and techniques with practical examples from scratch, from linear regression and logistic regression, to neural networks and recommender systems.

The course is taught in the Octave programming language due to its simplicity, and includes Octave code as the basis of the exercises. After doing the course in Octave, as the instructor intended, I then went back through and translated into Python, my preferred language, as well as I could. These notebooks were originally in a file structure that includes the various data sets from the course, but I haven't copied those to this repository as they can all be found in the course itself, hence there are a number of lines of code herein that need to be changed for your file structure once you have those requirements.

Hopefully the notebooks are clear enough to see what's going on, but do note that they are offered here without any guarantee of correctness. There are also a couple of things that I never got working properly in Python and didn't have the time to resolve. There are notes where these issues can be found. Otherwise, I hope some of the content here is found useful to other learners.
